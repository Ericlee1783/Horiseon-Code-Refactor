# Horiseon-Code-Refactor

## Description
My motivation to building this project was to refactor the code from non-semantic elements to semantic elements. All the non-semantic elements such as "div" are all replaced with semantic elements such as header, section, article, etc. Non-semantic elements are replaced due to them not having a certain meaning and does not necessary tell what it contains compared to using article. I learned throughout this project that semantic elements are essential to organize the content on html.
